# PyTorch Projects 

This repository contains various projects using PyTorch. 

**Pet_Classifier** is an Image Classifier on 4 types of animals that is trainined on personal images from an iPhone. This project is complete and the test set is 96% accurate. 

**Pothole_Finder** is a custom Object Detection trained on TeslaCam driving footage for detection of stoplights, cars, and potholes. This project is in progress.

**grism_classifier** is an Image Classifer that will identify unusuble grism data and classify morphology of complete emission line extractions. In the future, this will be trained on *Hubble Space Telescope* data from the 3D-HST survey. This project is in progress and is a portion of my dissertation work at the University of Kansas. The current irriteration has a 66% accuracy; I am currently working to improve this.
