# PyTorch Projects 

This repository contains various projects using PyTorch version 1.5 and Python 3.7.3. 

**Pet_Classifier** is an Image Classifier on 4 types of animals that is trainined on personal images from an iPhone. This project is complete and the test set is 96% accurate. 

**Pothole_Finder** is a custom Object Detection trained on TeslaCam driving footage for detection of stoplights, cars, and potholes. This project will also encompass real-time object tracking with video. This project is in progress.

**grism_classifier** is an Image Classifer that will identify unusuble grism data and classify morphology of complete emission line extractions. In the future, this will be trained on *Hubble Space Telescope* data from the 3D-HST survey. This project is in progress and is a portion of my dissertation work at the University of Kansas. The current irriteration has a 69% accuracy on 7 pointings of 2 orbit depth at z=0.5; I am currently working to improve this. While it detects artifact, noisy data, and diffuse sources well, it has trouble on compact sources. This may be due in part to small sample sizes and bias from my classification.
